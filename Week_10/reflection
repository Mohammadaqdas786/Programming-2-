Estimate Accuracy
How was your estimate accuracy usually?
My estimate accuracy varied initially, often being overly optimistic or pessimistic. Over time, I learned to better assess the complexity of tasks based on previous experiences and feedback.

How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?
As I progressed through the subject, I became more familiar with the types of tasks and their requirements, which led to improved accuracy in my estimates. I started using techniques like breaking tasks into smaller components and considering potential roadblocks.

What did you learn from doing these estimates?
I learned the importance of context and experience in making estimates. Additionally, I realized that involving team members in the estimation process often led to more accurate outcomes, as it brought diverse perspectives and knowledge.

Code Reviews
What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?
Being reviewed by others taught me the value of constructive criticism. I gained insights into best practices and alternative approaches to coding, which improved my skills and understanding of the codebase.

What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?
Conducting code reviews helped me develop a critical eye for detail and better understand common pitfalls in coding. It also reinforced the importance of clear communication, as I needed to provide feedback in a way that was helpful and respectful.

Good Code Reviews
Good Code Review 1
Explanation: In this review, I provided thorough feedback on the code's logic and suggested optimizations that improved performance. I also highlighted the importance of adhering to coding standards, which helped maintain consistency across the project.

Good Code Review 2
Explanation: This review focused on the readability of the code. I pointed out areas where variable names could be more descriptive and suggested breaking down complex functions into smaller, more manageable ones. This not only improved the code quality but also made it easier for future developers to understand.

Practicals
Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
If I were in charge of the subject, I would incorporate more collaborative projects to foster teamwork and communication skills. Additionally, I would provide more structured feedback sessions to help students learn from their mistakes and successes.

What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?
I excelled in time management and meeting deadlines for practical tasks. I also actively engaged with peers for collaborative learning, which enriched my understanding and made the practicals more enjoyable.
